## Welcome to the ChatGPT-Terminal! 

I'm excited to share this project with you!

This Terminal ChatGPT interface is written in Python to generate answers via the [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model (which is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com)). 

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, I would love to hear them. 
Thank you for visiting my GitHub page and considering my project!
